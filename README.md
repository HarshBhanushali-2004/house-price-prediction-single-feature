# House Price Prediction — Single Feature (Size)

This repository contains a machine learning project using **simple linear regression** to predict house prices based on **a single feature — size (in square feet)**.

This is part of my learning from the **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification** course by [DeepLearning.AI on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
